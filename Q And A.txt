1. Define each HTTP Status Code that you used in this project and explain where/when you should use them.

-201 -The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
-404 -The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
-400 â€“The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)..
-500- A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable..

- 200 - Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used.
 In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. 
 In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
 In a Trace request, the response will contain an request message received by server.
